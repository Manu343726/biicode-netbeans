biicode-netbeans
================

Scripts and instructions for easy interoperability between [biicode](http://www.biicode.com) and the netbeans IDE.


Why not just a gist?
--------------------

Github gists are better for short scripts like these, but they use a hash-based URL, which makes them hard to clone. A normal GitHub project has a simple 
`github.com/USER/PROJECT_NAME` URL format much more easier to remember and use.


Contents
--------

This project contains:

 - A `biicode-netbeans.md` file explaining how to create and use a Netbeans project which builds and manages dependencies through biicode tools. Also several scripts and instructions are provided
   to integrate biicode with Netbeans GUI (The build, clean and build, and run buttons).

 - The scripts menctioned above.

These documents and scripts are released without any special guarantee nor license. Be free to modify or distribute them, but note that neither biicode nor me are

my personal effort.
